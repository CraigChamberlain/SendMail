# SendMail
Module of helper tools for the MimeKit library replace and extend upon `Send-MailMessage`.

As you may know `Send-MailMessage` is depricated and there is no versitile replacement without having to import nuget packages or dlls and do C# coding in the powershell environment using a library such as [MimeKit](https://mimekit.net/).

This tool will have support for creating connections to any supported SMTP server with any supported [Authentication prococol](https://mimekit.net/docs/html/N_MailKit_Security.htm).  Initially only the most common authentication will have cmdlet support but I will expose a way of constructing your own MailKit objects without having to add-types which can be frustrating when jumping between machines.

I have replicated the API of `Send-MailMessage` so that the new module can replace it without re-writing anything other than the command.
